# Application process overview
==============================

Instead of manually asking for information from the possible applicant, we
automate and store their details to a database as an ephemeral resource. Once
they have decided to join our language program they're details will be put
into a more persistent state. Below we will outline the process of how
application works.

Usually the application is different for various kinds of client. If the for
example is willing to apply for the free program (sponsored) by an agency of 
sort.. we will proceed with it.

0. Application (ephemeral phase)
1. Schedule the initial meeting for the ephemeral applicant (E).
2. Send the initial necessary documents to the (E) applicant. Along with these
   documents is the Registration Form (Enrollment Form).
3. Screening the (E) applicant, when passed the (E) applicant will then
   transition to (P) persistent applicant. 
4. The (P) applicant will be scheduled for the "pre-interview" by TrueCare,
   when they passed the interview they will now be qualified for the
   free program! but if they fail, they're account will be flagged and then
   decision making will happen.
5. The candidate (P) applicants will now be then given a class schedules that
   they must complete. (Standard or Fast track).
