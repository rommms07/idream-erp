[users]

There are two kinds of user that will be able to utilize the system.
!!Normal User!! and !!Privileged User!! To know the difference between
these two, I constructed various dialog below of what are the most
use cases of these two utilizers.

[Normal User]

Normal user are those who aren't privileged enough to make an impact
to the system by changing the preferences or deleting a record. Usually
the privileged user will create at which domain a normal user is coming
from; If it is coming from nowhere it cannot manage or view anything in the
system; but if it is given a direction the normal user can start from there.

[Privileged User]

Privileged user can do everything they can in the system, from managing the list of
users. Make sure that there are only a few of these type of user in the system, as it
can be dangerous to have that many. If you want to give a user a specific access to
a resource use the `uflags` for setting the access.

[Ephemeral User]

Any user that are tagged as an ephemeral will be deleted by the system based on a 
period of time. Once the ephemeral user is deleted, its existence will cease from
the system and all of its data will be migrated to an archived storage.

===
User can become an ephemeral one, once they haven't logged in for a very long 
period of time, the system will automatically batch it for deletion!
===

===
User that are deactivated and not activated for a very long time will be turned into an
ephemeral inactive; this too will automatically be batched for deletion!
