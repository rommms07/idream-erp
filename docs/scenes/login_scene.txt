Let's say that I am Rom Villanueva who wants to login into the system...

1. I opened the website localhost:3000 and navigate to the login page.
2. Click the 'Login With Facebook' button.

  After a while... since I am terribly unlucky, the internet began to
  slow down, and then after that... BOOM! The internet disappears.

  I was terribly frustrated..

3. Luckily there is another way to sign up in the system, introducing the
   offline login mode! This mode lets a user continue to use the system
   even though they are offline. In this mode, the system will create
   an isolated database for data that will be input to the server, so
   when the internet goes back online the data will be flushed into the
   main database where all the data should be.

   I was like... :) Ok.

   Cons with this approach:

   - 

4. So, I decided to pick this option to login into the system. I navigate
   to the login page which the offline login page is located... and that
   took me about 400ms, and now I see the 'Login with Id Code'.. Finally,
   a terribly relieving sense wraps me.

5. I click the 'Login With ID Code', and then it takes me to the system!
   Viola~!

Now that the unlucky Rom is logged into the system... the internet goes back again!
The word that is coming out from his mouth taste likes a leaf of a poisonous plants.
He now decided that he wants to login as online.

6. There are two options or ways to login into the system again.. logout the current session,
   
   1. Go to the other login page specifically for online user and then login with Facebook. (not recommended)
   2. Click the profile dropdown and then click 'Toggle Online', done! (recommended)
